^^ Sound pack ^^
To install this filter you will need to locate your EasternSunLan install location. This Should be within  D2RLan\D2R\Mods\
Navigate to:
EasternSunLAN\EasternSunLAN.mpq\Data\D2RLAN\Filters
If this folder does not exist, you should create it
Within that folder you need to place the Sound folder containted within the soundpack. If the directory is not exactly correct
the filter cannot play the custom drop sounds.

The filter comes with 4 strictness levels. To cycle through strictness levels, while in game, press F12 -> Hotkey Controls -> and set a key to Cycle Filter Level. It's also a good idea to have a hotkey 
to refresh the filter in case of any weird stuff
Strictness Levels:

Leveling - This is mostly handled automatically while you are leveling  but can be cycled to in case you want to see items that stricter levels are hiding.
The leveling filter automatically starts filtering out low gems, potions, bases, etc.

Strict - Begins hiding low tier Runes and Rune decals. Hides non-class specific magic jewelry. This is relatively safe to start using around nightmare.

Very Strict - Begins hiding mid tier runes and rune decals. Hides ALL magic jewelry, charms, jewels. It also hides Normal quality uniques, and normal/exceptional quality set pieces. This is relatively safe to use when you start Hell.

Uber Strict - Begins hiding all ESR runes except the highest two tiers (gold and purple), only show high LoD runes, hides all set items, and all rare items except jewels, jewelry, and charms. This also filters out all base types except Mythicals.
Only use this when you have a strong understanding of itemization in this game and are establishing yourself in end-game maps.

Feel free to make any edits to this filter to fit your needs. I only request that you refer to https://locbones.github.io/D2RLAN-LootFilterGuide/ before asking questions that are answered there.

Always open to suggestions and if you notice anything out of place please let me know in discord with images and details.
